We are discussing Kubernetes annotations.
Annotations are key-value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects (like pods, deployments, services, etc.) to store arbitrary non-identifying metadata. Unlike labels, annotations are not used to identify or select objects. Instead, they are used to provide additional information about the object that can be used by tools, libraries, or users.
Key points about annotations:
- They can be structured or unstructured.
- They are useful for storing information that is not suitable for labels (e.g., long descriptions, build/release information, pointers to logging/monitoring/auditing tools, etc.).
- They are not used by Kubernetes internally; they are primarily for external use.
Syntax:
- Annotations are defined in the metadata section of an object.
- The key and value are both strings.
Example of annotations in a pod manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  annotations:
    # Example of a simple annotation
    author: "John Doe"
    # Example of a more structured key (using a domain prefix)
    example.com/contact: "https://example.com/contact"
    # Another example with build information
    buildNumber: "12345"
    gitCommit: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
    # Example of a longer description
    description: "This pod runs the main application for the project."
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: nginx:latest
```
Common use cases for annotations:
1. **Build/Release Information**: Attach version control commit IDs, build numbers, release IDs, etc.
2. **Deployment Information**: Track deployment timestamps, deployment tool metadata.
3. **Communication**: Provide contact details for the owner of the object.
4. **Tooling**: Store configuration for tools (e.g., ingress controllers, service meshes) that operate on the object.
5. **Logging/Monitoring**: Attach information about where logs are stored or which monitoring system to use.
Example: Ingress controllers often use annotations to configure settings that are specific to the ingress controller. For example, in an Ingress resource for Nginx Ingress Controller:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80
```
In this example, the annotations `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` and `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect` are used by the Nginx Ingress Controller to configure the behavior of the ingress.
Another example: Using annotations to add a description and contact information to a deployment.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
  annotations:
    description: "This deployment runs the frontend application for project X."
    contact: "team-x@example.com"
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.19.2
```
To view annotations of an existing object, you can use `kubectl describe`:
```bash
kubectl describe pod mypod
```
Or, to get a specific object and see its annotations in YAML format:
```bash
kubectl get pod mypod -o yaml
```
In the output, you will see the annotations under the `metadata` section.
Note: The keys in annotations are usually strings. If you want to avoid conflicts, you can use a domain prefix (like `example.com/key`) for your custom annotations, especially if you are developing a tool that uses annotations.
Remember: Annotations are not meant for data that is critical to the operation of the object because they are not processed by Kubernetes. They are for metadata that is external to Kubernetes.
